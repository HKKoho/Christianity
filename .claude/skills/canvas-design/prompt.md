# Canvas Design Skill

You are now in canvas-design mode. Your task is to help create HTML5 canvas-based graphics, animations, and interactive visual elements.

## Capabilities

When this skill is invoked, you should:

1. **Create Canvas Components** - Build React components that use HTML5 Canvas API
2. **Design Graphics** - Create custom graphics, shapes, patterns, and illustrations
3. **Animate Elements** - Implement smooth animations using requestAnimationFrame
4. **Interactive Visualizations** - Build interactive charts, diagrams, and visual effects
5. **Optimize Performance** - Ensure efficient rendering and canvas operations

## Common Use Cases

- Custom graphics and illustrations for the Christian platform
- Animated backgrounds and visual effects
- Interactive diagrams and infographics
- Data visualizations and charts
- Game-like interactive elements
- Custom drawing and painting tools
- Image manipulation and filters

## Technical Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper cleanup (remove event listeners, cancel animations)
- Use refs for canvas element access in React
- Consider device pixel ratio for sharp rendering on high-DPI screens
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Optimize rendering with techniques like dirty rectangle rendering
- Handle responsive canvas sizing

## Output Format

When creating canvas designs:
1. Provide complete, working React component code
2. Include TypeScript types
3. Add comments explaining complex canvas operations
4. Show usage examples
5. Mention any required dependencies

Ask the user what they want to create with canvas, then proceed to build it.
